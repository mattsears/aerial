Aerial
====

Aerial is a simple, blogish, web application written in Sinatra.
Designed for developers, there is no admin interface and no SQL database.
Articles are written in your favorite text editor and versioned with Git.
Comments are handled by Disqus (http://disqus.com). It uses Grit
(http://github.com/mojombo/grit) to interface with local Git repositories.

Aerial also comes with a static site generator. Why, you ask?  Well,
static pages offer a lot of benefits: First, static pages load
lightning fast.  It also allows web browsers to cache files much more
efficiently due to Last-Modified headers and such.

Aerial can now run on Heroku! Initially, Aerial didn't work on Heroku
since the .git directory is completely obliterated on each deployment.
With static pages and little help from a couple Rack middleware
plugins, getting Aerial on Heroku is a snap.

Aerial was designed for small personal blogs and simple static websites
such as marketing sites. The main goals are to provide a no-fuss alternative
with a basic set features.

Aerial is still in active development.
